# Bear Extruder And X Axis


## Introduction

This is a better extruder and X axis for Prusa i3 printer MK2(s), MK2.5 and MK3. It is a following of the Prusa's printers improvements I started few months ago with my [Bear Upgrade project](https://github.com/gregsaun/prusa_i3_bear_upgrade)


## Features

### Already implemented

1. Extruder motor is closer by 5mm to X rods to avoid vibration
1. Extruder is lighter
1. Perfect filament path (check [this issue](https://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-i3/issues/51))
1. Self-centring of motor to get a perfect position of Bondtech drive gear
1. Ventilation of hotend sink as been highly improved
1. Perfect belt alignment (top and bottom of belts are parallel)
1. X ends have been beefed up
1. X motor is closer to X axis rods to reduce vibration
1. New tensioning system that keeps the belt perfectly aligned no matter the adjustment
1. Use shaft for x-end idler bearing (instead of screw) and dual bearing 16T idler
1. Easier to remove extruder for maintenance (changing the PTFE tube for example)
1. Include a tool to insert Z bearing easily
1. Open source by providing STL and Autodesk Fusion 360 files

### Ongoing

1. Try to make x-carriage-cover easier to use during maintenance
1. Create MK3 and MK2s version
1. Use a shorter PTFE tube to improve flexible filament extrusion
1. Provide STEP files


## Status

:warning: This is an ongoing development, not even a beta version for now. Use it with care. Any feedback is very welcome :relaxed:


## Manual

The manual contains bill of material (BOM), print settings and assembly instructions.

[Read it here](manual/)


## Compatibility

:warning: **NONE** of the original extruder and X axis is compatible with this project! Belt path, X motor position, screws positions and length (...) differ.
